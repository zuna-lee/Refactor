<p>TML (Text Mining Library) is a general Text Mining library with a focus on Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). 
 It allows to create semantic spaces (see Deerwester, 1998) from a corpus of documents with detailed parameters. 
 This spaces can then be used as background knowledge to calculate distances between documents (or passages) and terms of a different corpus.
 Typical operations are the similarity between each document in a corpus, or the distances between consecutive sentences in a document.</p>
